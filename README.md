# LifeExpectancyProject

I built this project in 2016. It was my first data science project, and I did not even know I was doing data science.

The project is very simple. It takes the average of your life expectancy from your current age, gender, race, and from the state you live in. The project was built in the form of an app. It takes input from the user, and it performs calculations. A funny part from the project is that it adds a pause to simulate difficult calculations. The data used to calculate life expectancy was taken from public sources.

This project really shows me how much I have grown as a data scientist.
